## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to add a nice hover effect on an image.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Styling Images](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp) - A section "Image Hover Overlay" of this W3Schools tutorial has good examples of how to add hover effects to images. It helped me to learn how to do it. I really liked these examples and will use them going forward.
- [Code example on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_css_image_overlay_opacity) - This is one of the examples that helped me with my solution.
